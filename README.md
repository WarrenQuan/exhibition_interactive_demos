# Interactive Demos for Exhibition
Through prototyping, I investigated differents ways for visitors to access information about artworks in the Brooklyn Artists Exhibition, both two dimensional and three dimensional. Through this, I looked into libraries and softwares such as Micr.io, third-party naviagation websites, and from scratch with ThreeJS.
